My name is Penelope Haulotte, and I am a PhD candidate studying philosophy and Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) at the University of New Mexico. My work generally focuses on historical reconstructions of German idealist philosophy and contemporary political interventions into trans theory, history, and activism. I am currently on the Bilinski Dissertation Completion Fellowship for 2024-2025AY, and plan to graduate in the Spring of 2025. I am one of the co-founders of _The Karasu Society_, an independent organization for the advancement of philosophy in Albuquerque. I was also managing editor of _TSQ_ from 2022-2023.

I am a proud gay trans Texan woman who learned to love philosophy at a small liberal arts college. We did not have specialists in my areas of interest, but I was constantly amazed by the lengths my professors would go to further my education and feed my passion. My aim in life is to continue to give to others the great gift that was given to me. I aim to be very broadly interested in the history of philosophy, emulating my own very accommodating and flexible teachers.
