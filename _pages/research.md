I have two main research programs: the history of German Idealism and contemporary trans theory.

My research in the history of German Idealism is reflected in my dissertation, _Harmony and Disquietude: Leibnizian Currents in German Idealist Thought_ directed by Adrian Johnston. Here my central ambition to offer resources for reimagining the standard 'from Kant to Hegel' narrative that dominates the Anglo-American reception of these works through a sustained examination of its Leibnizian inheritance. I therefore repeatedly emphasize the importance and distinctiveness of various supposedly 'minor' figures, such as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Moses Mendelssohn, Salomon Maimon, and Johann Gottlieb Fichte, among others. _Harmony and Disquietude_ offers a systematic reassessment of the Pantheism Controversy and its implications for the history of European thought. 

My research in trans theory is devoted to the development of a systematic existential-phenomenology of gender dysphoria. In my "Program for a Transgender Existentialism" (_TSQ_ 10.1, 2023) I propose a general orientation for trans phnomenology. I see the central ambition of transgender phenomenology as embodied in the promise to suspend or neutralize the unrecognized prejudices and predispositions belonging to what I call "the cisgender attitude." Later, in my "Gender Dysphoria for Critical Theory," I try to actualize this program through performing a trans phenomenological suspension on the traditional clinical model of gender dysphoria. In my view, gender dysphoria is not the psychological distress of living in the 'wrong-body,' but the political unfreedom marked by alienation from cisgender society. I hope to continue to develop these ideas into a monograph that would promise to be a fully systematic phenomenology of gender dysphoria.
