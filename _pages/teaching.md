Teaching is central to my self-conception as a philosopher. I think that philosophy is most important when it speaks to existential questions concerning how we choose to live our lives, and accordingly, it is my aim to show how sources in the history of philosophy can speak to and with our contemporary problems. Below I list a few of the courses I have been able to teach as lead instructor, their syllabi, my reasoning for the structure of the class, and selected student comments.

**Phil 1110: Introduction to Philosophy**

I approach my introduction to philosophy class with the recognition that for many who take this class, this will be their first and perhaps last foray into academic philosophy. But this will not be the last time they will think philosophically. For philosophy is concerned first and foremost with concrete questions plaguing everyday life. What makes life worth living? Is it better to live as someone who is the victim or the perpetrator of injustice? Should we fear death? Why and how do we come to feel alienated by our society – and what are its causes? Is this situation inevitable? How can I know? What can I do? What must I do? This class seeks to address the core of these fundamental existential problems using the resources of the history of philosophy, broadly conceived. My goal is to provide important food for thought for those who take this course as a non-major, but also to showcase various styles and traditions of philosophical investigation for those interested in further pursuing philosophy academically. I therefore use many non-traditional sources to exemplify the vast diversity of philosophical styles and traditions. 

Selected Student Comment: “I feel like I genuinely learned a lot about Philosophy and I now have a real interest in the subject… The assignments were challenging and interesting… In short I loved this class and I would absolutely take another class in this field if Penelope was teaching.” 

**Phil 2210: Early Modern Philosophy**

The early modern period is intensely interesting: you have the emergence of experimental and natural science, the development modern secular state through seemingly endless religious and political unrest, and perhaps above all the rich philosophical tradition of early modern metaphysics. In my early modern philosophy class, my goal is to show to students that we continue to study the early modern period of philosophy because the questions they asked and the approaches they took to answering those questions remain with us in some way today. In my class, we read many of the classical sources in early modern metaphysics, such as Rene Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, G.W. Leibniz, John Locke, John Berkeley, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant, but do so alongside less traditional sources, such as Princess Elizabeth, Anton Wilhelm Amo, Emilie du Chatelet, Moses Mendelssohn, Pierre Bayle, Blaise Pascal, Gotthold Lessing, and various others. What emerges – I hope – is a dynamic landscape whose complexity resonates with our contemporary situation. 

Selected Student Comment 1: “Penelope was such an amazing instructor, online, no less, that I have decided to join the philosophy department. If Penelope taught more classes, I would take them even if I didn't need them. This person is truly brilliant. To be able to talk, again, online, about such nuanced and dense topics in a way that makes them accessible and easy to understand is a huge accomplishment. Functionally Penelope is understanding and easy to communicate with. I loved this class and its early modern philosophy... could be very dry - was not. I really appreciate Penelope and having the time to learn with and from them.”

Selected Student Comment 2: “Penelope is an intuitive, enthusiastic and modern philosopher. She constantly ensures the class is understanding the material and makes the lessons fun. I would definitely take a 300 class of hers… This class has helped me to understand the foundations of Philosophy in more ways than almost any I’ve taken.”

**Phil 2220: Introduction to Ancient Greek Philosophy**

Pierre Hadot argues that one reason ancient Greek thinkers are challenging for their contemporary readers is that they did not aim to establish a theoretical doctrine but a spiritual practice and way of life. Taking my cue from Hadot, I structure my introduction to ancient Greek philosophy class around how the Greeks asked questions about metaphysics (the study of ultimate reality), epistemology (the study of knowledge), and, most importantly, the good life. We begin with the Presocratics, proceed to discuss some of the most important dialogues from Plato, and then finally cover Aristotle and Hellenistic philosophy. Here I make an effort to relate philosophical texts to other forms of Greek thought and cultural production, as for example when I have students read selected fragments from Sappho’s poetry with the Symposium and Euclid alongside Plato’s Theaetetus. Classroom assignments are structured around reflective papers and weekly discussion rather than a traditional research paper.

**Gndr 2210: Introduction to Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies**
