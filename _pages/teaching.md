Teaching is central to my self-conception as a philosopher. I think that philosophy is most important when it speaks to existential questions concerning how we choose to live our lives, and accordingly, it is my aim to show how sources in the history of philosophy can speak to and with our contemporary problems. You can find my YouTube channel with many of my lectures to students [here.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtJC1C32h333kvKqwVPBSMQ) Below are some of the classes I have taught and short descriptions of my approach.
